The Instrument/Form HTML Editor
===============================

The Form HTML Editor provides a high-level interface to the form
creation or modification of an entire instrument or form. We suggest
avoiding this interface unless familiar with JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.
This view allows direct editing of instrument properties for advanced
users.
