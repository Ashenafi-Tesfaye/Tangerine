Creating a New Group
====================

Upon logging into your Tangerine instance, you will see a screen listing
your Tangerine groups and/or the opportunity to create new groups. You
might think of groups as discrete data collection efforts that might
contain several instruments or forms. If you have, e.g., a baseline data
collection and an endline data collection for the same project, you
might make these two different groups. When packaging your instruments
into the apk (.apk is the application installation file format for
Android devices) for installation on an Android device, Tangerine
packages all instruments in a group. Thus, you should set up groups and
categorize instruments accordingly.

Click "**Create New Group**" in the screen below.

WARNING: If you are using the free service you **are not able** to
create new groups.

If you are a Tangerine subscriber, the user1 account can be configured
to be the only account with permissions to create new groups. If this is
desired, please send a request for this configuration to
