Editing Instrument Sections
===========================

Once you have selected to edit your new or existing instrument/form, you
will see a screen like the one below. This view lists the different
sections of your instrument. Each section can contain one or more items.

On the tablet, items in any one section can be seen on a single screen.
The user moves through items by "scrolling" down the screen. The user
moves through sections by hitting "Next" or "Back" on the tablet.

The form editor provides the interface for adding and editing instrument
sections and items. This interface provides controls that make the
following actions possible:

-   **EDIT HTML** - This converts the interface from a WYSIWYG ("what
    you see is what you get") to a HTML code interface

-   **PREVIEW** -- This control enables you to have a preview of your
    form in the current state

-   **SAVE** -- This control allows you to save the form in its current
    state

-   **ADVANCED** -- This Control enables you to access the on-open logic
    and on-change logic. This logic is used for skipping an entire
    instrument section.

-   **ADD SECTION** -- This allows you to add a section of items to your
    instrument.

-   **EDIT**  <img src="./media/image14.png" height="30">
-- This icon opens the interface to
    edit an instrument section (e.g., add items)

-   **DELETE**  <img src="./media/image15.png" height="30"> -- This icon deletes this instrument
    section

In this view, you can drag sections to reorder them.
