    <h3> Subtask 5: Oral Reading Passage</h3>
    <p><strong>Here is a short story. I want you to read it aloud, quickly but carefully. When you finish, I will ask you some questions about what you have read. When I say &ldquo;Begin,&rdquo; read the story as best as you can. If you come to a word you do not know, go on to the next word. Put your finger on the first word. </strong></p><p><strong>Ready? Begin.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
