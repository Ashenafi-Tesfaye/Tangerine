  <p>LET'S BEGIN PART THREE. I will now ask you to go back to your assigned seat with the tablet and headphones. Please wear the headphones, and hit the large green button on the screen when you are ready to begin to answer questions. During this past school year how many times did ANYONE do any of the following things to you when you were at school or when you were traveling to or from school and you did not want them to? Please indicate on the tablet if this "Never" happened in the last school year, if it happened “Once,” "A few times," or if it happened "Many times." If you do not want to answer the question, please hit the “No response” button. If you have any questions, please raise your hand and I will assist you. When you see the big red circle on your screen, please return back to me</p>
